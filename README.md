The reason for my domain is to build a mobile system for an Animal Haven.
The Haven runs off various types of Schedules with each Schedule containing both an Animal and User.
A User can be of various UserTypes. Such as staff, volunteer, student, donor.
Adoptions also take place at this Haven with each Adoption linking an animal, user and the date the adoption took place.
Multilple animals of the same breed can make use of the same LivingArea, these areas also help keep track of where each animal is.
Both Users and Animals can be part of various schedules like playTime, feeding, excersize and so forth.
Users are allowed to make multiple Donations.
